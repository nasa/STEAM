# Purpose  
This directory is intended to hold any files necessary for characterizing and
loading the STEAM recommended module set for use on the FSL. In theory, it 
should work on any system that leverages an 
[Lmod Module system](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) if that system has
all the necessary modules with all the same exact names.  So I guess it's not too
likely to work anywhere other than the FSL.
